To open the file we should follow the following syntax

our_variable = open(filename, mode)

Modes

r   read mode
w   write mode(creates new file and overwrites an existing file)
x   write mode(only for new line)
a   append mode(creates a new file or adds content to the end of an existing file)

We can also use a second mode indicator

t for text
b for binary

Available options would be rt, wt, xt, at, rb, wb, xb, ab

While the file is open we can use read(), readline(), and readlines() to read data from
the file.

It is very important to always close the file once we are done with it.
The following syntax is the one we use for closing the file.

our_variable.close()

Writing to a file

myFile = open('filename')
myFile.write('sometext') -> or a variable
myFile.close()

Reading a text file

my_file = open(filepath, 'r')
data = file1.read()
