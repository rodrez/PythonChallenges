import re

email_validation = re.compile(r'''([a-zA-Z0-9._&=-] + @[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+(\.[a-zA-Z] (2,4)))''', re.VERBOSE)

a-z is the same as typing the whole alphabet
^ -caret [^5] will match any character except '5'. If the caret appears elsewhere,
it does not have any special meaning
If you need to match [ or \, we can precede them with \[ or \\.
\w matches any alphanumeric character. Is equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_]

\d Matches any decimal digit; is the equivalent to [0-9]
\D Matches any non-decimal digit; is the equivalent to [^0-9]
\s Matches any whitespace character; is equivalent to [ \t\n\r\f\v]
\S Matches any non-whitespace character; equivalent to [^ \t\n\r\f\v]
\w Matches any alphanumeric character; equivalent to [a-zA-z0-9_]
\W Matches any non-alphanumeric character; equivalent to [^a-zA-z0-9_]

These sequences can be included inside a character class. For example [\s,.] will match whitespace
and '.' or ','
